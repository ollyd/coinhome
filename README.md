#Background

This real estate app was devised in order to solve the problem of foreign investors paying large sums in currency conversion in order to buy a home in Australia. The solution was to provide a Bitcoin real estate lsistings site where properties can be viewed free of charge, and property owners can be contacted directly, thus eliminating the need for costly agent fees. With payment for properties only being accepted in Bitcoin, currency conversion fees for foreign buyers is negated. 

A secondary problem is that many are still fearful of Bitcoin as a currency. Therefore in order to provide further peace of mind, the site offers a complimentary Arbitrator marketplace. Users can browse Arbitrator profiles, contact arbitrators, and agree terms in order to perform a Bitcoin multisig transaction. The purpose of this being added security in what would be a large sum transaction. Finally, the aim is also to include and complete the multisig transaction through the app.
